Abstract: Attitudinal Network Graphs are network graphs where edges capture an expressed opinion, specifically, if two vertices connected by that edge are agreeable or antagonistic.  Attitudinal Network Graphs can be characterized as a whole by measuring the level of consensus of entire graph, and through status and influence of each vertex in the graph. In this paper we characterize vertices and edges with respect to entire graph, and propose metrics to quantify vertex influence on consensus and strength of its expressed attitudes. We propose to expand the notion of frustration index of a signed graph to \emph{frustration cloud}, a collection of \emph{nearest} balanced states for a given network. The frustration cloud resolves the consensus problem with \emph{minimal sentiment disruption}, taking all possible consensus views over the entire network into consideration. A frustration cloud based approach removes the brittleness of traditional network graph analysis, as it allows one to examine the consensus on entire graph.  A spanning-tree-based balancing algorithm captures the variations of balanced states and global consensus of the network, and enables us to measure vertex status and attitude.  The proposed approach provides a parsimonious account of the differences between strong and weak statuses and influences of a vertex in a large network, as demonstrated on sample Highland tribe and Wikipedia administrator election data.  The method accurately models the Highland tribe network in terms of true alliances, successfully predicts administrator election outcome consistent with Wikipedia's real election outcomes, and provides deeper analytic insights into attitudinal network graph outcome, such as most influential vertices and outliers.
